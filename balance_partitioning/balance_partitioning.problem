TEST Balance partitioning of an array

Consider a sequence of N integers where the Kth value is defined as (2K + 4)
Sample values [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28 ...] 

Input N as the length of this sequence, return the index I such that sum of all values to left of I is as close as possible to sum of the values to the right.

Sample ./a.out 10     Output: 7    

Explanation
Sequence: N = 10 
[4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22]

Partitioning at I = 6
Partitions [4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14] and [18, 20, 22]  
Left sum 54
Right sum 60

Calculate the balance partition for N as 50, 1000, 10000, 100000
